# Semantic segmentation

This repository entails code and resources from a machine learning competition on semantic Image segmentation.
This project is hosted on kaggle and the dataset contains images and their respective masks. Semantic image segmentation provides pixel wise compared to that of object localization in which a bounding box is applied on the detected image. It has various use cases like in self driving cars and biomedics

The goal of this project is to build a model to segment images on the data trained on. 
Due to computational reason I reduced the model complexity therefore resulting in a less accurate prediction. This project just serves as a sneak peek to what the original model can achieve.

If you are interested in the competition or just want to learn more about the project, you can check the resources in this repositiory.
